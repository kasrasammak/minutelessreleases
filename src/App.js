          This is the first release of Minuteless Recordings. <br></br>
          Compiled by Kasra Sammak of K-Owl. <br></br>
          It is a collection of tracks from 14 different artists. <br></br>
          The intent behind this compilation was<br></br>
          to create something new and interesting, <br></br>
          and we hope we have accomplished that. <br></br>
          All the production behind this compilation was done in-house: <br></br>
          Tracks written and produced by artists themselves.<br></br>
          Mastering done by Daniel of Audionimus<br></br>
          with the exemption of tracks x, y, and z, <br></br>
          which were self-masters.<br></br>
          Artwork done by Kasra Sammak.<br></br>
          Artwork is a blend of hand-drawings made by various artists from this compilation.<br></br>
          No other images were used to make this artwork. <br></br>
          Even this website itself was written by Kasra Sammak.<br></br>
          You may not preview this compilation, you can only download it for free.<br></br>
          We hope you enjoy!!!
